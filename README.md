# 🎭 Algeria-Vision: Public Figure Recognition System  

## 📚 Project Description  
**Algeria-Vision** is an innovative AI-driven application that simplifies the detection and recognition of public figures from television streams. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning technologies like MTCNN and YOLOv5, the system detects faces, identifies them by comparing with a pre-built database, and generates detailed reports on their appearances. This project serves as a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing multimedia content in real-time, helping organizations monitor public figure activities efficiently.
